I was afraid to be me
Be anyone you want to be
Be anyone you want to be
I don't blame my week
For my not being able to speak
Clearly about things I've said before
And if it's light outside, night will fall
Night will fall
And if it's life, it resolves
It resolves
Anywhere you are in a maze is a lie
Anywhere you are on a page, you still go to the right
Anytime there's no ground below you, you're in the sky
Anytime you're afraid, it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
I was a flame in the night
I heard what I wanted to hear
And the moment I disappeared
I grew the size of all outside
'Cause I became one with the night
I became one with the night
And if it's real, it's not all
It's not all there is
There's a lot in what appears not to be there at all
And you can't function as someone besides who you are
And you can't function as someone besides who you are
And you can't function as someone besides who you are
And you can't function as someone besides who you are
