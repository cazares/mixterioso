One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to've met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
I like you

[Verse 2]
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything about a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
I like you

[Interlude]
You, you, you
You, you
Ahh!

[Verse 1]
One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to've met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips, you're my vitamins
I like you
